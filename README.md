# Thymble

Thimble is an Ruby on Rails 5 community-based news platform platform. Much like Reddit or Hacker News, users are identified by peudonyms and all content posted user generated. 

Visit [thymble.org](http://www.thymble.org/) for a working demo.

Google, Reddit, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit have an incredible amount of power to put whatever they want in front of your eyeballs and shut you up when it's in their best interest. This has been especially evident in the 2016 presidential election. 

Since anyone can fork this repository to deploy their own news community site, Thimble helps to decentralize the power of "big tech" companies and "mainstream media" outlets. We develop features based on what we believe makes a strong news site community. If you are a designer or developer that is passionate about changing the centralized landscape of news media, contribute your ideas, code, and designs and help us disrupt the current system and build something new.
